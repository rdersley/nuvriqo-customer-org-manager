# Data handling — Nuvriqo Customer & Organisation Manager

_Last checked against the code: 30 September 2026 (app version 0.7.0)._

This is the source of truth for the Privacy & Security questionnaire and the public security page. If the code changes what is read, written or stored, update this file in the same pull request.

## Architecture

- Forge-native Jira admin page (`jira:adminPage`) with one resolver function, plus one issue event trigger for Client → Organisation sync.
- No Forge Remote, no external fetch, no vendor-operated servers, no analytics.
- Every call from the admin page uses `api.asUser()`, so it runs with the signed-in administrator's own permissions.
- The sync event trigger has no signed-in user, so it uses `api.asApp()`. It reads only the configured fields of the ticket that changed, and writes only its Organizations field.
- Every resolver first checks that the caller has the Jira **Administer** global permission.

## Data read from Jira / JSM

| Data | API | Why |
|---|---|---|
| The caller's Administer permission | `GET /rest/api/3/mypermissions` | Admin-only access check on every call |
| Service projects (id, name) | `GET /rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk` | Service-project picker |
| Customers of a service project (account id, display name, email) | `GET /rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/{id}/customer` | Customer list/search and the import comparison |
| Organisations (id, name) | `GET /rest/servicedeskapi/organization` | Organisation list, and matching CSV organisation names |
| Bulk task status | `GET /jsm/csm/api/v1/tasks/{id}` | Import History status column |
| Customer detail field definitions (name, type, options) | `GET /jsm/csm/api/v1/customer/details` | Import column mapping, and checking detail values before import |
| Jira field list (id, name, type) | `GET /rest/api/3/field` | Finding the Organizations and Request Type fields, and Client field candidates |
| A ticket's project, Client, Organizations and Request Type fields | `GET /rest/api/3/issue/{id}?fields=…` | Sync: deciding the correct organisations |
| Tickets in the selected projects with a Client value (the same fields) | `POST /rest/api/3/search/jql` | Sync health check |
| Client value suggestions | `GET /rest/api/3/jql/autocompletedata/suggestions` | Filling in the mapping table |
| An imported customer's account id, found by email | `GET /rest/api/3/user/search?query=<email>` | Finishing an import batch: adding the customer to the service project and organisations |

Customer names, emails and detail values are shown in the browser and used in memory for the preview. **They are never written to app storage.** Saved mappings and import sessions store column header names only.

## Data written to Jira / JSM

| Change | API | When |
|---|---|---|
| Create an organisation | `POST /rest/servicedeskapi/organization` | Only for organisation names that a complete scan of the site proved missing, when an administrator clicks Import or Resume |
| Create or update customer accounts (email, display name, and the customer detail values mapped in the import; blank cells are not sent) | `POST /jsm/csm/api/v1/customer/profile/bulk` | When an administrator clicks Import or Resume; at most 100 rows per request, each with an idempotency key |
| Add imported customers to the selected service project | `POST /rest/servicedeskapi/servicedesk/{id}/customer` | After each batch's bulk task ends; up to 50 accounts per call |
| Add imported customers to their organisations | `POST /rest/servicedeskapi/organization/{id}/user` | After each batch's bulk task ends; up to 50 accounts per call |
| Set a ticket's Organizations field | `PUT /rest/api/3/issue/{id}` (Organizations field only) | Sync: when sync is on and a ticket in a selected project is created or its Client changes (as the app); or when an administrator confirms **Correct N tickets** (as the administrator) |

## CSV files

- The CSV is read and parsed **in the administrator's browser**.
- For files of 500 rows or fewer, rows are sent to the resolver for validation; the resolver returns errors and keeps nothing.
- Rows being imported are sent to the resolver in batches of 100 and passed straight to the Jira bulk API. The resolver keeps nothing from the rows.
- The browser computes a SHA-256 fingerprint of the file so an interrupted import can be recognised and resumed. Only the fingerprint is stored, not the file.

## Data stored in Forge storage (KVS)

Installation-scoped Forge KVS only. No customer names or email addresses are stored.

| Key | Contents | Retention |
|---|---|---|
| `import-session:<id>` | Import session: file name, file fingerprint, service project id, row counts, batch counts, status, per-batch Jira task ids, idempotency keys, whether each batch finished and how many rows were added or need fixing, timestamps | 180 days after last update (KVS TTL) |
| `import-session-rows:<id>:<n>` | The CSV row numbers the session will import (numbers only), in chunks of 5,000 | 180 days after last update |
| `import-recovery:<serviceDeskId>:<fingerprint>` | Pointer to the session that can be resumed for a file | 180 days, or deleted when the session completes |
| `import:<idempotencyKey>` | Bulk task record: Jira task id, batch number, row count, row range, timestamp | 180 days |
| `import-mapping:<id>` | Saved CSV column mapping: mapping name, service project id, CSV header names | Until an administrator deletes it |
| `sync-config` | Sync settings: on/off, Client, optional second, Organizations and Request Type field ids, project keys, ignored request type ids, and the Client value (plus optional second-field value) → organisation id/name mappings | Until changed |
| `sync-health` | The last ticket check's counts, and unmapped Client values with ticket counts | Replaced by the next check |
| `sync-log:<time>:<issueKey>` | A correction: issue key, Client value, organisation ids before and after, and why (client changed / new ticket / bulk correction / no mapping) | 90 days (KVS TTL) |
| `detail-sync-config` | Ticket details settings: on/off, project keys, customer detail name → ticket field id/name/type mappings, a select field's option names, and the placeholder values to replace | Until changed |
| `detail-sync-log:<time>:<issueKey>` | A ticket the app filled in: issue key, the names of the fields set, why (new ticket / reporter changed / bulk update / failed) and any error. No customer detail values | 90 days (KVS TTL) |

**Personal data:** the app stores no Atlassian account IDs, emails or names (Client values and organisation names are business data), so it does not use the Personal Data Reporting API (`report:personal-data` is not requested). The CSV file name is stored as typed by the administrator; admins should avoid putting personal data in file names.

## Licensing and read-only mode

In production, a site without an active licence can still browse and preview, but every resolver that changes Jira or app storage refuses the call (see `src/license.js`).

## Uninstall

After uninstall, the installation's KVS data is removed by Atlassian under Forge's hosted-storage retention policy. Confirm the current retention window in Atlassian's Forge documentation before quoting a number in the questionnaire. Changes already made in Jira (customers, organisations) stay in Jira.

## External egress

None. `manifest.yml` declares no external fetch permissions.
